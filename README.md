# Student Admission and Management System

---

## üìö Project Overview

The **Student Admission and Management System** is a Java-based, menu-driven application that streamlines the processes of student registration, admission, record maintenance, and reporting for university administrators. Designed as a learning and practical project, it simulates real-world admission workflows, emphasizing automation, accuracy, and user-friendliness in the command-line environment.

> **Note:**  
> The MySQL database for this project is intended to be set up and run locally on your machine. The database is not hosted online.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Interactive Console UI**: Simple, menu-driven navigation for all major administrative tasks.
- **Student Admission**: Admit students based on rank and branch preferences, with eligibility checks for VIT Vellore and VIT AP.
- **Automated Registration Number & Email Generation**: Unique IDs and institution email addresses for each new student.
- **Branch-wise & Campus-wise Management**: Separate records and operations for CSE/ECE branches and both campuses.
- **Student Record Viewing**: View, search, and display details of all or individual students.
- **Password Update**: Securely update student passwords.
- **Admission Cancellation**: Delete student records with backup to a canceled students' table.
- **Statistical Reporting**: Get total counts per branch and campus.
- **Error Handling**: Input validation and informative prompts throughout.

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema (MySQL)

This project requires a MySQL database with the following tables:

### 1. `csestudents` (CSE Student Records)
### 2. `ecestudents` (ECE Student Records)
### 3. `Cancelled_Students` (Backup of Cancelled Admissions)

**Each table has the same structure:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE csestudents (
    RegNo VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    CollegeID INT,
    ApplicationNo VARCHAR(20),
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Email VARCHAR(100),
    Password VARCHAR(100),
    PhoneNo VARCHAR(20),
    ranks INT
);

CREATE TABLE ecestudents (
    RegNo VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    CollegeID INT,
    ApplicationNo VARCHAR(20),
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Email VARCHAR(100),
    Password VARCHAR(100),
    PhoneNo VARCHAR(20),
    ranks INT
);

CREATE TABLE Cancelled_Students (
    RegNo VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    CollegeID INT,
    ApplicationNo VARCHAR(20),
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Email VARCHAR(100),
    Password VARCHAR(100),
    PhoneNo VARCHAR(20),
    ranks INT
);
```

> **To use this application:**
>
> 1. **Create a MySQL database** (e.g., `student_management`).
> 2. **Create the three tables** above in your database (you can use phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, or the MySQL CLI).
> 3. **Update the database credentials** (username, password, database name) in the `DBconnect` class in your Java code to match your local setup.

2. **Input Student Details:**  
   Enter application number, rank, name, and phone number.

3. **Eligibility & Options:**  
   - If rank < 5000: Eligible for both CSE/ECE at Vellore and AP
   - If rank 5001‚Äì10000: Eligible for ECE at Vellore, CSE/ECE at AP
   - If rank 10001‚Äì20000: Eligible for ECE at AP only

4. **Branch & Campus Selection:**  
   Choose college and branch interactively.

5. **Record Creation:**  
   System generates registration number and email, stores all details in the database.
